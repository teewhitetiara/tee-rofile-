      <section class="text">
        <p>Currently, I go to the Craig Newmark School of Journalism. I inspire to become a News Figure on TV and become a News Anchor and Meterologist. The inspiration came because currenlty I am a  teacher and I teach science and health.I enjoy working with children and collaborating with other teachers. In college, I took a speech class that strengthened my orator skills and made me comfortable in front of the students. Moreover, I am a part-time actress. Taking public speaking classes allowed me to have the confidence to record self-tapes in front of a camera for auditions. As an actress, I can shift between different characters depending on the audience's needs. For all the reasons combing my biology background and acting experience.I know I wanted to be on camera as a News Anchor and Meterologist!</p>
        <p>Skills: On-camera skills, coding,writing scripts, audtion skills, Pro-tools </p>
